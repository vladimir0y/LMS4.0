# Mobile Testing Guide for LMS

## Overview
This guide outlines the responsive design improvements and testing procedures for mobile breakpoints using Chrome DevTools.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Line-clamp Integration
- âœ… Installed `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` plugin
- âœ… Updated Tailwind config to include the plugin
- âœ… Removed custom CSS line-clamp utilities in favor of the official plugin
- âœ… Applied line-clamp to:
  - Course card titles (`line-clamp-2`)
  - Course card descriptions (`line-clamp-3`)
  - Course page descriptions (`line-clamp-4`)
  - Lesson titles in sidebar (`line-clamp-2`)
  - Media player header titles (`line-clamp-2`)

### 2. Semantic HTML & Accessibility
- âœ… Converted divs to semantic elements:
  - `<article>` for course cards
  - `<header>`, `<footer>` for card sections
  - `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<main>` for layout
  - `<nav>` with proper aria-labels
  - `<ol>` and `<li>` for lesson lists

- âœ… Added ARIA attributes:
  - `aria-current="page"` for active lessons
  - `role="navigation"` and `aria-label` for navigation areas
  - `role="progressbar"` with progress values
  - `aria-live="polite"` for dynamic status updates
  - `aria-describedby` for additional context

- âœ… Keyboard navigation support:
  - All interactive elements are proper `<button>` elements
  - Added keyboard event handlers for Enter/Space keys
  - Focus states with `focus:ring-2` for visibility
  - Skip to content functionality via semantic structure

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness Enhancements
- âœ… Responsive text sizing with clamp functions
- âœ… Improved button sizing on mobile (smaller padding on small screens)
- âœ… Enhanced grid layouts with proper breakpoints
- âœ… Better spacing and touch targets for mobile

## Testing Mobile Breakpoints with Chrome DevTools

### 1. Open Chrome DevTools
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Press `F12` or right-click and select "Inspect"
3. Click the device toolbar icon (ðŸ“±) or press `Ctrl+Shift+M`

### 2. Test Standard Mobile Devices
Test the following device presets:
- **iPhone SE (375px)** - Small mobile
- **iPhone 12 Pro (390px)** - Standard mobile
- **iPad (768px)** - Tablet
- **iPad Pro (1024px)** - Large tablet

### 3. Test Custom Breakpoints
Test these specific breakpoints used in our Tailwind classes:
- **320px** - Extra small mobile
- **375px** - Small mobile (iPhone SE)
- **414px** - Large mobile (iPhone Plus)
- **768px** - Tablet (md: breakpoint)
- **1024px** - Large tablet/small desktop (lg: breakpoint)
- **1280px** - Desktop (xl: breakpoint)

### 4. What to Test

#### A. Layout Responsiveness
- [ ] Hero section scales properly
- [ ] Course grid collapses from 3â†’2â†’1 columns
- [ ] Two-column course page becomes single column on mobile
- [ ] Navigation elements stack appropriately
- [ ] Text remains readable at all sizes

#### B. Interactive Elements
- [ ] Buttons are easily tappable (minimum 44px touch target)
- [ ] Focus states are visible when using keyboard
- [ ] Hover states work on devices that support them
- [ ] Active lesson highlighting is clear

#### C. Text Content
- [ ] Line-clamped text shows ellipsis appropriately
- [ ] All text remains legible at small sizes
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling required
- [ ] Proper line spacing maintained

#### D. Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Screen reader navigation works (test with browser screen reader)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
- [ ] Proper focus management
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG standards

### 5. Testing Procedure

#### Step 1: Home Page Testing
1. Set device to iPhone SE (375px)
2. Verify hero section layout
3. Check course card grid (should be 1 column)
4. Test button interactions
5. Verify course card text truncation

#### Step 2: Course Page Testing
1. Navigate to a course page
2. Verify single-column layout on mobile
3. Test lesson sidebar functionality
4. Check media player responsiveness
5. Verify keyboard navigation through lessons

#### Step 3: Keyboard Navigation Testing
1. Use Tab key to navigate through all interactive elements
2. Verify focus indicators are visible
3. Test Enter/Space key activation
4. Ensure logical tab order

#### Step 4: Screen Reader Testing
1. Enable browser screen reader
2. Navigate through page structure
3. Verify proper heading hierarchy
4. Test ARIA labels and descriptions

### 6. Expected Behaviors

#### Mobile (320px - 767px)
- Single column layout
- Stacked hero buttons
- Compressed navigation
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Line-clamped text with ellipsis

#### Tablet (768px - 1023px)
- Two-column course grid
- Side-by-side hero buttons
- Expanded navigation
- Larger touch targets

#### Desktop (1024px+)
- Three-column course grid
- Full navigation
- Hover effects enabled
- Optimized for mouse interaction

## Common Issues to Watch For
- Text overflow without proper truncation
- Buttons too small for touch interaction
- Horizontal scrolling
- Overlapping elements
- Poor contrast ratios
- Missing focus indicators

## Performance Testing
- Use Lighthouse audit for performance metrics
- Test on 3G throttling for realistic conditions
- Check for layout shift during loading
